## 2. Prediction for Corona virus epidemic

This [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L408IE2IShjoEZ-6Vvak1Hg0y6YNSpuofATq6b__GnI) shows that using news and public data in the internet can predict when the epidemic will end. Fomular in the analysis of this slide are deomonstrated in [an excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O6-EPNCW4Uxh9tq08C96z4RjKN7dLhQvipXBMZgZeyo/edit?gid=0#gid=0). You can download the file and change parameters to see how predictions change.
